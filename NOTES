q: could run this script either in cloud or from some remote device
-- make it so that it runs in the cloud; we're all-in, plus that way 
it works on chromebooks
-- that suggests that you want ssh capability fairly early on, and that there will be a second phase of init that happens over ssh

template can be ADD'ed from dockerfile or via docker cmd

todo:
. basic build of dev environment
. add ssh; run
. run crd
. add template
