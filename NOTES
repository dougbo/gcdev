q: could run this script either in cloud or from some remote device
-- make it so that it runs in the cloud; we're all-in, plus that way 
it works on chromebooks
-- that suggests that you want ssh capability fairly early on, and that there will be a second phase of init that happens over ssh

template can be ADD'ed from dockerfile or via docker cmd

todo:
. add template
. split google dev env
. split android studio; cloud work

issues:
. make local store per-user per-project
. take container as parameter for edit
. resume existing ssh session
.. maybe refuse if there's more than one?


gcdev init --project dougbo  
<- sets default project. need to gcdev set [project] or gcedit --project <x> to change
<- also sets initial parameters, some of which can't be reset: e.g., editor/template/lang

gcdev list [--project x]

gcdev edit [--project x] [--container x] [--restart] 
<- starts or restarts per-user editing environment for given project
. standard usage: no running containers -- creates per-user container and runs crd
. reports container ID

. if one container exists and is running, or if container specified and is running
restarts crd if --restart
.. else 
.. verifies project is the same as current and reports container ID; else restarts crd
. reports container ID
